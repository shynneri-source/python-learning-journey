# Python Learning Journey

A comprehensive learning repository for mastering Python from foundational concepts to advanced applications in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Backend Development.

## üìö Project Structure

This project is organized into progressive learning stages, starting with Python fundamentals and expanding into specialized domains.

### Phase 1: Python Basics ‚úÖ (Completed)

The foundation of your Python learning journey, covering essential concepts and syntax.

#### Included Modules:

- **Variables_and_Data_Types.py** - Understanding Python's fundamental data types (int, float, str, bool, etc.)
- **Basic_Syntax.py** - Core syntax rules, comments, indentation, and Python conventions
- **Conditionals.py** - Control flow with if, elif, else statements and logical operators
- **loops.py** - Iteration with for and while loops, loop control statements
- **Functions.py** - Function definition, parameters, return values, scope, and best practices
- **Lists_Tuples_Sets_and_Dictionaries.py** - Collections: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and their methods
- **Typecasting.py** - Type conversion and casting between different data types
- **Exceptions.py** - Error handling with try-except-finally, custom exceptions
